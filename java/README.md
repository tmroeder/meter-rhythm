# The original applet

The java files in this directory make up the original applet implementation from
1998. The code quality is low and there aren't any automatic tests. But this is
the version that was originally published.

To run the original applet, first compile the code with `javac Rhythm.java`,
then call `appletviewer page.html` or `javaws page.html`. The `appletviewer`
program will produce fewer complaints, since it is intended for debugging, not
production code.
