State machine for Rhythm

States:

- commIntro = "This demonstrates the concepts in Chapter 7 of Christopher
  Hasty's 'Meter as Rhythm'. Imagine time 0 as an instant that is a potential
  beginning of a sound, yet prior to and independent of it.";
  - 0
- comm1MoveStart = "The first sound begins, but time 0 will not be a beginning
  until it is past.";
  - 1
- comm1MoveP5 = "The first sound is becoming. Time 0 becomes its beginning.
  'Projective potential'--the potential of a duration to be reproduced by a
  successive duration--accumulates, as indicated by the solid arc.";
  - 2
- comm1MoveA5 = "The first sound's duration is so long that it is 'mensurally
  indeterminate'--it has lost its projective potential to be reproduced.";
  - 3
- commEnd1Right = "The first sound ends. Its duration is 'mensurally
  determinate' because it has the potential for being precisely reproduced.";
  - 4
- commEnd1Wrong = "The first sound ends; it is too long to have projective
  potential.";
  - 5
- commPLimit = "There is a pause between the first two sounds. Its duration is
  relatively indeterminate, if our attention is focused on the beginning of
  sounds. The growing arc indicates that the duration of the first sound *plus*
  the following silence itself has the 'projective potential' to be
  reproduced.";
  - 6
- commPLimitEvent = "This beginning of the second sound 'realizes' the
  projective potential of the duration begun by the first event's attack. The
  solid arrow represents this projective potential. The event now beginning has
  the potential to reproduce this past duration. The dotted arc, extending for
  this duration into the future, symbolizes this 'projected potential'.";
  - 7
- commALimitEvent = "The second sound begins. It is so long since the beginning
  of the first event that the interonset duration is mensurally
  indeterminate--it has no potential to be reproduced--so there is no
  projection.";
  - 8
- commP2bMove = "The accumulating duration of the second sound is realizing the
  projected potential (symbolized by the dashed arc) of the first interonset
  duration. Simultaneously the present event accumulates its own projective
  potential (represented by the growing solid arc) to be reproduced by a
  successive, third event.";
  - 9
- commA2bPbPLimitMove = "The second sound exceeds the duration projected at its
  onset; the projection is not clearly realized, as indicated by the X through
  the dashed arc.";

  indeterminate. (The projection of the first interonset duration is not
  realized.)";
  - 11
- commP2bEvent = "The second sound ends. Its duration is 'mensurally
  determinate' because it has the potential for being precisely reproduced. But
  it does not affect the projection of the first interonset duration, shown by
  the arrow and dashed arc";
  - 12
- commA2bPbLimitEvent = "The second sound exceeds the duration projected at its
  onset. The projection is not clearly realized, as indicated by the X through
  the dashed arc. The projective potential of the duration initiated by the
  second sound's beginning continues to accumulate.";
  - 13
- commAbPLimitEventIn2 = "The second sound is so long that it is mensurally
  indeterminate. Since the projected potential of the first interonset duration
  is denied there is no projection at all.";
  - 14
- commAcPEbPLimitMove = "The silence between the second and third sounds is
  relatively indeterminate if our attention is focused on the sounds'
  beginnings. The growing arc indicates that the duration from the beginning of
  the second sound up to now, including the silence, has 'projective potential'
  to be reproduced.";
  - 15
- commAbPLimitMove = "The time since the beginning of the second sound is
  mensurally indeterminate, having no projective potential to be reproduced.";
  - 16
- commdP2bAE175bEvent = "The beginning of the third sound is earlier than
  projected. The second interonset duration is shorter than, but at least
  three-fourths of the first interonset duration. We feel an *acceleration*
  because we sense the realization of the first projected duration even as we
  also perceive the difference between the two durations.";
  - 17
- commdE2bEvent = "Since the third sound begins exactly at the end of the
  projected duration (the upper dashed arc), the projected duration is
  'realized'. A new projection is created,conditioned by the first, in which the
  second interonset duration has the projective potential (the lower arrow) to
  be reproduced.";
  - 18
- commAbPLimitEvent = "The projective potential of the first interonset duration
  (the dashed arc) is realized, but the projective potential of the second
  interonset duration is not, since it is mensurally indeterminate. Because the
  third sound begins much later than projected, we may come to feel 'hiatus'
  (symbolized by the double bar)--a break between the realization of projected
  potential and a new beginning. A new and relatively unconditioned potential
  emerges from the beginning of the third sound.";
  - 19
- commdP175bEvent1 = "The projection of the first interonset duration is
  realized. Another projection (the rightmost arrow and dashed arc) can be
  completed within the promised duration, so may enhance its mensural
  determinacy. The emergence of a new beginning, shown in parentheses, would
  clarify this.";
  - 20
- commdP175bEvent2 = "In this interpretation the accent symbolizes an
  unequivocal second beginning that denies the projection of the first
  interonset duration in order to realize a larger projective potential,
  symbolized by the large arrow.";
  - 21
- commdB2t25Event = "The beginning of the third sound is slightly later than
  projected. We hear a *deceleration* because we sense the realization of the
  first projected duration even as we also perceive the difference between the
  two durations.";
  - 22
- commA25bPbPLimitEvent = "The third sound begins somewhat later than projected. A new projection, indicated by the lowest arrow and dashed arc, emerges, breaking off from the emerging first projection. We reject the relevance of the first projection to the mensural determinacy of the second interonset duration.";
